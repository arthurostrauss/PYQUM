"""
        QUBIT SPECTROSCOPY
This sequence involves sending a saturation pulse to the qubit, placing it in a mixed state,
and then measuring the state of the resonator across various qubit drive intermediate dfs.
In order to facilitate the qubit search, the qubit pulse duration and amplitude can be changed manually in the QUA
program directly without having to modify the configuration.

The data is post-processed to determine the qubit resonance frequency, which can then be used to adjust
the qubit intermediate frequency in the configuration under "qubit_IF".

Note that it can happen that the qubit is excited by the image sideband or LO leakage instead of the desired sideband.
This is why calibrating the qubit mixer is highly recommended.

This step can be repeated using the "x180" operation to adjust the pulse parameters (amplitude, duration, frequency)
before performing the next calibration steps.

Prerequisites:
    - Identification of the resonator's resonance frequency when coupled to the qubit in question (referred to as "resonator_spectroscopy_multiplexed").
    - Calibration of the IQ mixer connected to the qubit drive line (whether it's an external mixer or an Octave port).
    - Set the flux bias to the maximum frequency point, labeled as "max_frequency_point", in the configuration.
    - Configuration of the cw pulse amplitude (const_amp) and duration (const_len) to transition the qubit into a mixed state.
    - Specification of the expected qubits T1 in the configuration.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Update the qubit frequency, labeled as "qubit_IF_q", in the configuration.
